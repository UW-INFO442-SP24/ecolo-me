## Mission/Summary
The current patterns of consumption and production are unsustainable, leading to environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequalities. Overconsumption, waste generation, and inefficient resource use contribute to this problem. Lack of awareness, convenience, and societal norms also perpetuate unsustainable practices. Additionally, the pandemic only worsened the issues with our consumption levels by doubling the amount of fossil fuel subsidies between 2020 and 2021 (Fossil Fuels Consumption Subsidies 2022 â€“ Analysis - IEA, 2023).

According to the UN, governments need to implement and enforce policies and regulations that include measures such as setting targets for reducing waste, promoting economic practices, and supporting sustainable procurement policies. (Goal 12 | Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2023) Individuals can choose products with lower environmental impacts and reduce the carbon footprint of day-to-day activities. To promote a more sustainable lifestyle, we propose to have a curated series of challenges on our website to encourage individuals to adopt eco-friendly habits and make conscious choices towards sustainable consumption.

For this project, we plan to address the lack of awareness and inconvenience as primary causes of unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Many individuals are unaware of the environmental impact of their daily choices, and even when they are aware, they may find it inconvenient or challenging to adopt more sustainable habits due to various barriers. 

## Problem Statement
